47. introduction: we'll be implementing the client side of the auth flow goals:

    implementing login and register
    creating components (cli)
    using angular template forms
    angular services
    observables
    structural directives
    component communication parent <=> child using input/output
48. Creating a nav bar

49. Introduction to Angular template forms

50. Introduction to Angular services

51. Injecting services into components

52. Using conditionals to show and remove content

53. Using the angular bootstrap components dropdown

54. Introduction to observables

55. Persisting the login

56. Using the async pipe

57. Adding a home page

58. Adding a register form

59. Parent to child communication

60. Child to parent communication

61. Hooking up the register method to the service

62. Section 5 summary

  * implemented the register functionality.
  * creating components
  * forms => two way binding
  * angular services for sharing data => singletons in their provided scope
  * observables, async pipes for subscribing/unsubscribing to observables
  * structural directives => conditionally rendering elements
  * parent child communication => Input/Output
